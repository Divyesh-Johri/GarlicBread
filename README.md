# GarlicBread
It's garlic bread.
And just so you know, I really love garlic bread.
Like you don't get it.
If I had to choose between a trillion dollars with an executive job opportunity at Microsoft playing golf in my own mansion's lawn with my two kids playing tag and my wife coming out with lemonade from the pool deck and GARLIC BREAD, I would chomp that spicy toast down faster than a Muslim's first meal after Ramadan.
